        <p><strong>Islamic Donations: A Path to Everlasting Rewards</strong></p>
        <p>In Islam, giving charity (sadaqah) is a fundamental act of worship that brings immense rewards. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: 
        <em>"When a person dies, his deeds come to an end except for three: Sadaqah Jariyah (continuous charity), knowledge which benefits others, or a righteous child who prays for him."</em> (Muslim)</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Islamic Charity</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Zakat</strong>: A mandatory donation (2.5% of wealth) given to those in need.</li>
            <li><strong>Sadaqah</strong>: Voluntary charity given at any time to help others.</li>
            <li><strong>Sadaqah Jariyah</strong>: A continuous charity that benefits people long-term, such as building a mosque, school, or well.</li>
            <li><strong>Waqf</strong>: A form of perpetual charity where an asset is donated for ongoing community benefits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Donate?</h2>
        <p>Your contributions help fund essential projects like clean water access, education, healthcare, and supporting orphans. Every donation is an opportunity to earn ongoing rewards in this life and the hereafter.</p>
