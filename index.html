    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Perpetual Sadaqa Fund is dedicated to fostering long-term charitable impact through sustainable giving, inspired by the principles of Islam. Our mission is to uplift communities by funding projects that provide continuous benefits, ensuring that every donation has a lasting effect.</p>

    <h3>Our Values</h3>
    <p>We are guided by core Islamic values, ensuring that every contribution is used in ways that align with faith-based ethics and community welfare:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ikhlas (Sincerity):</strong> All efforts are carried out with pure intentions, seeking only the pleasure of Allah (SWT).</li>
        <li><strong>Barakah (Blessings):</strong> Donations are directed toward projects that offer long-term benefits and bring prosperity to those in need.</li>
        <li><strong>Amanah (Trust):</strong> We uphold transparency and accountability, ensuring that every contribution is managed with the utmost integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Justice & Compassion:</strong> We prioritize supporting vulnerable communities with fairness and kindness, following the principles of equity in Islam.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Islamic Tradition of Sadaqah Jariyah</h3>
    <p>In Islam, **Sadaqah Jariyah** (continuous charity) is a noble form of giving that continues to benefit people even after the donor has passed away. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:</p>
    <blockquote>
        “When a person dies, all their deeds come to an end except three:  
        **Sadaqah Jariyah (continuous charity), beneficial knowledge, and a righteous child who prays for them.**”  
        <em>— (Sahih Muslim)</em>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Through the Perpetual Sadaqa Fund, we strive to establish initiatives that generate ongoing rewards for donors, such as clean water projects, education, and community development.</p>

    <h3>Why Your Support Matters</h3>
    <p>By contributing to our fund, you are not only providing immediate relief but also creating a legacy of positive change. Every well built, every meal provided, and every educational program supported is a source of ongoing blessings.</p>
